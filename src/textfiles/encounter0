You encountered a guard! Prepare to Fight.

You will be prompted with one of 3 actions:
1. Attacked
2. Blocking
3. Exposed

Each Action has a corresponding successful response:
1. 'Block' to stop an attack. Failure to do so will lose 1 HP.
2. 'Pause' to catch your breath. Attacking or Blocking unecessarily will 
	tire you, making you unable to react to the next Action.
3. 'Attack' to hurt the enemy. A failed attack will leave you less time 
	to react to the next Action.
	
Type 'ready' to begin.
